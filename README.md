# Group work break-down strategy
Hooriya - worked on the functionality for searching tweets, searching users, listing followers, following a user, and unfollowing a user. For the **Search Tweets** and **Search Users** features, I implemented the logic to filter and retrieve relevant data based on user input. I also developed functionality to **list followers** and enabled users to follow and unfollow other users, with appropriate validations to prevent redundant actions. After implementing these features, I conducted extensive testing to ensure they worked as expected, verifying edge cases like searching for non-existent tweets or users, and handling invalid follow/unfollow attempts. I also helped debug issues related to database queries and user input errors. Throughout this process, I collaborated with the team to integrate these features with the overall application, assisting teammates with overlapping functionalities and resolving any database conflicts.

Sho - worked on the sql. write the sql for find most 5 tweets and retweets for every login user, list user by keywords, find the detail of user after another user clicked into their profile, list 3 recent tweets of that user, add the follower to user's follower list and able to check more tweets after click check more tweets. I also helped team with using github and test the program at the end, also discuss with teammates about the functionality implement ways. Throughout this process, I collaborated with the team to integrate these features with the overall application, assisting teammates with overlapping functionalities and resolving any database conflicts. 

Hana - focused on building the core features for user registration, login, tweet composition, and displaying a personalized feed. I set up validation for registration inputs (like email format and password confirmation) to improve data integrity. For the Feed Display, I implemented logic to show tweets and retweets from followed users in chronological order, with a “load more” option. I also made sure SQL queries were secure and helped troubleshoot user input and data validation issues. Throughout, I worked with the team to test and integrate these features smoothly, addressing any issues that arose along the way.

Angela: Implemented the following queries: 1) Find out if userID and pwd exist in table by searching through it 2) Register any users that do not exist 3) Search for tweets by prompting users to enter one or more keywords. If the tweet matches a keyword or a hashtag, return its content with the unique identifier, the author ID, the content of the tweet, date, time, and if the tweet was a reply to another tweet, it will store the original tweets unique ID. 4) Compose a tweet: prompting the user to compose a tweet 5)List followers . 
I also assisted in testing functions via unit tests. As well, I created the DesignDoc, where I worked on the General Overview of the System, including the System Workflow and User Guide, and the Component Structure and Design.
