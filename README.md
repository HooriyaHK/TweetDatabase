# Group work break-down strategy
Hooriya - worked on the functionality for searching tweets, searching users, listing followers, following a user, and unfollowing a user. For the **Search Tweets** and **Search Users** features, I implemented the logic to filter and retrieve relevant data based on user input. I also developed functionality to **list followers** and enabled users to follow and unfollow other users, with appropriate validations to prevent redundant actions. After implementing these features, I conducted extensive testing to ensure they worked as expected, verifying edge cases like searching for non-existent tweets or users, and handling invalid follow/unfollow attempts. I also helped debug issues related to database queries and user input errors. Throughout this process, I collaborated with the team to integrate these features with the overall application, assisting teammates with overlapping functionalities and resolving any database conflicts.

Angela: Implemented the following queries: 1) Find out if userID and pwd exist in table by searching through it 2) Register any users that do not exist 3) Search for tweets by prompting users to enter one or more keywords. If the tweet matches a keyword or a hashtag, return its content with the unique identifier, the author ID, the content of the tweet, date, time, and if the tweet was a reply to another tweet, it will store the original tweets unique ID. 4) Compose a tweet: prompting the user to compose a tweet 5)List followers . 
I also assisted in testing functions via unit tests. As well, I created the DesignDoc, where I worked on the General Overview of the System, including the System Workflow and User Guide, and the Component Structure and Design.
