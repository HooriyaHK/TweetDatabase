Hooriya - worked on the functionality for searching tweets, searching users, listing followers, following a user, and unfollowing a user. For the **Search Tweets** and **Search Users** features, I implemented the logic to filter and retrieve relevant data based on user input. I also developed functionality to **list followers** and enabled users to follow and unfollow other users, with appropriate validations to prevent redundant actions. After implementing these features, I conducted extensive testing to ensure they worked as expected, verifying edge cases like searching for non-existent tweets or users, and handling invalid follow/unfollow attempts. I also helped debug issues related to database queries and user input errors. Throughout this process, I collaborated with the team to integrate these features with the overall application, assisting teammates with overlapping functionalities and resolving any database conflicts.

Sho - worked on the sql. write the sql for find most 5 tweets and retweets for every login user, list user by keywords, find the detail of user after another user clicked into their profile, list 3 recent tweets of that user, add the follower to user's follower list and able to check more tweets after click check more tweets. I also helped team with using github and test the program at the end, also discuss with teammates about the functionality implement ways. Throughout this process, I collaborated with the team to integrate these features with the overall application, assisting teammates with overlapping functionalities and resolving any database conflicts.
